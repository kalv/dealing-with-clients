# Benefits of freelancing

- Get to work with a number of projects over a short time
- Keeping busy in-between employment
- Learn how to really ship, maybe no project manager, talk to clients/users

!SLIDE
# Understand the why

- What does the client need and why
- Pop the why stack
- Try to dig deeper into why they want to hire you and build something
  - For board proposal, funding, more users, happy customers??

!SLIDE
# Where to find clients

- Network, meet other developers,
- Build something, get your portfolio up
- Send out emails to mailing lists, to people you know
- ODesk sometimes works for people looking for same timezone
- HN Freelancers, post a "looking for work"

!SLIDE
# Listen vs pitch

- People remember how you make them feel not what they say
- Resist the urge to talk about yourself and your services until the right time

!SLIDE
# Hourly Charging

- You can juggle and perhaps be open to more clients that can only afford 10 hours.
- Be careful to make sure you can actually get enough done in that time
- Harder for you to context-switch, I’ve met very few developers that can do this well

!SLIDE
# Fixed Rate Charging

- The “how much will it cost for you to build the whole thing”
- Lots of time upfront nailing the spec
- Sign off the spec to help steer the “Can I also have…” situations

!SLIDE
# Focused iterations

- Agile weeks, focused delivery and push to a milestone (release, feature)
- If client is worried, give them a get out clause (after one week, can leave)
- (We do this at Brewhouse)

!SLIDE
# How to work

- Hours, logging, Harvest
- Daily updates, standups, wrap ups
- Weekly iterations, plan and focus your time if you can

!SLIDE
# How to work cont'd

- Invoice the client, register as self-employed, create a self-employed entity
- Manage your taxes, keep things in check constantly
- Use Wave Accounting (invoices, tracking of billing, etc.)
- Put aside your tax monies! (it’s ok to be more, 30%).
- Don’t open a Corp/Inc until you need, more work.

!SLIDE
# Quality of work

- If you don’t write tests for a client, I will find you.
- Testing code, write things the Rails way for portability, better for the client
- Continuous Integration (get the client onboard early)
- Deploy often on each feature, the client can then accept that
- Encourage constant conversation (in a chat room even)

!SLIDE
# Don't

- Support or host, get the client to pay, supporting adds up
- Work more hours than needed, don't set bad expectations
- If you don't know, you don't know (spike)
- Lie / Cheat - our industry is small, build for the long term
